## Origin of the project

The initial goal of this project is to link an animated element (i.e. image, text, graphics...) to the local time of your machine. 
We decided to make a project around apero time with cheers expressions in different languages, daddy jokes around alcohol as well as a red wine bottle filling automatically when you launch the page.

In order to complete this project, we added a map collecting all bars in France with details, such as opening time, phone number, types of beers available, PMR adopted, and so on.
We also added a quiz page with 15 funny questions to test your alcohol culture. 

## Techstack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- JQuery
- JSON 
- SVG


## What we did

- We managed to create an animated image with a svg file: we collected the image online and we were able to empty it and fill it automatically.
- We managed to use an API from a opendata website that collects all bars in France.
- We managed to use a local JSON file for the first time to display randomly cheers expressions in different languages (linked to the local time) with a time interval function. 
- We managed to create a typeform-ish quiz on our dedicated page and to stock users' answers with a correction system that shows two different colors when it comes to the correct or wrong answer.
- We managed to implement a random GIF system when we click on the button. The GIF comes from the official API of GIPHY.com.

## What we couldn't do

- We couldn't link the animation to the local time of our machine.
- We couldn't find a way to activate the Geolocation on our map due to some permission issues. 
- We couldn't make a request from the online JSON file due to permission issues that we cannot solve. 
- We didn't have enough time to link the Google Maps API with detailed attendance of each bar to our map.
